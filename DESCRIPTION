Description: The Decision Analytic Modeling Package ('dampack') is a suite of functions for analyzing and 
    visualizing the health economic outputs of mathematical models. This package was developed with funding from 
    the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under award 
    no. R01AI138783. The content of this package is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not 
    necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health. The theoretical underpinnings
    of `dampack`'s functionality are detailed in Hunink et al. (2014) <doi:10.1017/CBO9781139506779>.
