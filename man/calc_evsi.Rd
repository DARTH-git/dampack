\arguments{
\item{psa}{object of class psa, produced by \code{\link{make_psa_obj}}}

\item{wtp}{willingness-to-pay threshold}

\item{params}{A vector of parameter names to be analyzed in terms of EVPPI.}

\item{outcome}{either net monetary benefit (\code{"nmb"})
or net health benefit (\code{"nhb"})}

\item{type}{either generalized additive models (\code{"gam"}) or
polynomial models (\code{"poly"})}

\item{poly.order}{order of the polynomial, if \code{type == "poly"}}

\item{k}{basis dimension, if \code{type == "gam"}}

\item{n}{additional sample size}

\item{n0}{initial sample size}

\item{n_by_param}{if \code{TRUE}, each parameter in the metamodel can have a unique
initial and additional sample size. \code{n} and \code{n0} must be numerical
vectors of equal length to \code{params}, with each value corresponding to the
initial and additional sample sizes for each parameter in the metamodel. By default,
\code{n_by_param = FALSE}, and each value of \code{n} and \code{n0} is shared by
each parameter in the model. When \code{n_by_param = FALSE}, \code{n0} must be a single
numeric value, and \code{n} must be a numerical vector of additional sample sizes for
which EVSI is calculated from the metamodel.}

\item{pop}{A scalar that corresponds to the total population}
