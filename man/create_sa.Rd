\title{A generic sensitivity analysis object}
\usage{
create_sa(
  parameters,
  parnames,
  effectiveness,
  strategies,
  cost,
  currency,
  other_outcome
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a data frame with parameter values for each model run. Each
column should represent a different parameter, and each row should represent a
simulation (in the same order as \code{cost} and \code{effectiveness})}

\item{parnames}{names for the parameters.}

\item{strategies}{vector with the names of the strategies. Due to requirements in
certain uses of this vector, this function uses \code{\link{make.names}} to modify
strategy names as necessary. It is strongly suggested that you follow the rules
in the \code{\link{make.names}} help page, to avoid unexpected errors.}

\item{cost, effectiveness, other_outcome}{data frames containing data for costs,
effectiveness or another outcome (user-defined), respectively.
Each simulation should be a row of the data frame, and each strategy should be a column.
Naming the columns of the data frames is not necessary, as they will be renamed with
the \code{strategies} vector.}

\item{currency}{symbol for the currency being used (ex. "$", "Â£")}
}
\value{
returns "sa" sensitivity analysis object.
}
\description{
This function is called by \code{\link{make_psa_obj}},
\code{\link{create_dsa_oneway}},
and \code{\link{create_dsa_oneway}}, and checks the structure of
each of the arguments before creating an SA object.
