  currency = "$")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class \code{ceac}. A melted data frame produced by
function \code{ceac} with each strategy's probability of being
cost-effective for each willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold}

\item{...}{additional arguments to plot (not used)}

\item{title}{String with graph's title}

\item{txtsize}{number with text size}

\item{currency}{String with currency used in the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA).
Default: $, but it could be any currency symbol or word (e.g., £, €, peso)}

}
\description{
Plots the CEAC as a \code{ggplot2} object calculated with \code{\link{ceac}}.
}
\section{Details}{

\code{ceac} computes the probability of each of the strategies being
cost-effective at each \code{wtp} value.
