\title{Plot of Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves (CEAC)}
\usage{
\method{plot}{ceac}(x, frontier = TRUE,
  title = "Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves", txtsize = 12,
  currency = "$", min_prob = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class \code{ceac}. A melted data frame produced by
function \code{ceac} with each strategy's probability of being
cost-effective for each willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold}

\item{frontier}{Whether to plot acceptability frontier}

\item{title}{String with graph's title}

\item{txtsize}{number with text size}

\item{currency}{String with currency used in the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA).}

\item{min_prob}{minimum probability to show strategy in plot.
For example, if the min_prob is 0.05, only strategies that ever
exceed Pr(Cost Effective) = 0.05 will be plotted. Most useful in situations
with many strategies.

Default: $, but it could be any currency symbol or word (e.g., £, €, peso)}

\item{...}{additional arguments to plot (not used)}
}
\value{
ceac.gg A \code{ggplot2} object with the CEAC
}
\description{
Plots the CEAC as a \code{ggplot2} object calculated with \code{\link{ceac}}.
}
\section{Details}{

\code{ceac} computes the probability of each of the strategies being
cost-effective at each \code{wtp} value.
