# Probablistic Sensitivty Analysis Generation

This vignette explains how to use `dampack` to generate your own PSA using only a decision analytic model and information about the distributions that define your model parameters of interest. If both costs and effects are calculated within the decision model, the resulting `psa` object will be compatible with all of `dampack`'s PSA analysis functions, which are explained at length in the `psa_analysis` vignette (type `vignette("psa_generation", package = "dampack")` in the console to view this vignette).

## Decision Model Format

In order to generate a PSA in `dampack`, the user must input the code for the decision analytic model in a standardized format that is compatible with the `run_psa` function. This is the same format required for the `FUN` argument of `run_owsa_det` and `run_twsa_det`.

The user-defined model function must accept a single input containing a list of the parameters from the `params_basecase` argument. In the example model shown below, this list is named `l_params_all`, and the variables contained in this list are the only variables that are allowed to be varied through the `params_range` argument in the DSA. Optionally, additional function inputs for `FUN` can be supplied through the `...` argument of `run_owsa_det`/`run_twsa_det`, but these inputs are not allowed to vary in the sensitivity analysis. These additional inputs must be arguments of `FUN`, like `n_wtp` in the example of `calculate_ce_out()` below. `FUN` and its component functions are also able to incorporate variables stored in the global environment, such as `n_age_init` or `n_age_max` in the example.

The user-defined model function must return a data.frame where the first column contains a character vector of the strategy names, and the subsequent columns contain numeric vectors of all relevant model outcomes. Each row of the data.frame will consist of a strategy name followed by the corresponding outcome values for that strategy. These model outcomes must be calculated internally within `FUN`. The model outcomes are not limited to typical outcomes like cost or effectiveness and can be any numerical outcome that the user chooses to model.

## Generating Parameter Samples for a PSA

The `gen_psa_samp` function creates a `data.frame` of parameter value samples based on the underlying distributions specified by the user. Each row of the returned `data.frame` is an independently sampled set of the parameters varied in the PSA. To produce a `psa` object, the `run_psa` function will take each row of this `data.frame` and calculate the outcomes for each strategy in the user-defined model. The `data.frame` returned by `gen_psa_samp` matches the format required by the `parameters` argument of the `make_psa_obj` function.

`gen_psa_samp` has five arguments: `params` is a vector containing the names of each parameter to be varied in the PSA; `dists` is a vector of the same length indicating which type of distribution this parameter will be drawn from; `parameterization_types` is a vector indicating the format of how these parameter distributions are defined; `dists_params` is a list of vectors, where each element of the list contains the values necessary to define the distribution for a parameter based upon its corresponding element of `dists` and `parameterization_types`; and finally, `nsamp` is a numeric value indicating the number of PSA samples to be generated. 

Details about the allowable distributions, their parameterization types and the corresponding formats for `dists_params` can be found in the help documentation by typing `?gen_psa_samp` in the console. Within the example below, the first parameter in the PSA, `"p_HS1"`, follows a `"beta"` distribution, which has an `"a, b"` parameterization type (which stands for alpha, beta), and the two values for alpha and beta are `30` and `170`, respectively. If the user does not possess estimates for the alpha and beta parameters for the beta distribution but does have estimates for the mean and standard deviation of `"p_HS1"`, they also could choose to parameterize this distribution using `parameterization_types = "mean, sd"`. In this case, the first element of the dists_params list would need to be a numeric vector of length 2 containing the estimated mean and standard deviation for `"p_HS1"`. `dampack` would then use a method-of-moments estimator to calculate an alpha and beta parameter for this distribution from which the PSA sample values are drawn.

## Generating Outcomes for the PSA

The `run_psa` function is used to calculate outcomes for each strategy for every PSA sample through the user-defined decision model, `FUN`. In this example, the `data.frame` of PSA parameters generated by `gen_psa_samp` should be used as the input for the `psa_samp` argument. The combination of the parameters in the `psa_samp` and the `params_basecase` argument must define every parameter that `FUN` expects within its `l_params_all` input argument. Other parameters for `FUN` that are not contained within `l_params_all` list, like the `n_wtp` argument of `calculate_ce_out` can be passed through `...` as an additional argument in `run_psa`. If the decision model in `FUN` is computationally slow and/or the number of PSA samples is extremely large, `run_psa` could take a long time to run. Under these circumstances, it is recommended that you set the `progress` argument to `TRUE` in order to print a progress bar in the console while the function is running to monitor its progress.

```{r}
l_params_basecase <- list(u_D = 0, c_D = 0, d_e = 0.03, d_c = 0.03,
                          p_HS1 = NA, p_S1H = NA, p_S1S2 = NA, p_HD = NA,
                          hr_S1 = NA, hr_S2 = NA, c_H = NA, c_S1 = NA,
                          c_S2 = NA, c_Trt = NA, u_H = NA, u_S1 = NA, u_S2 = NA,
                          u_Trt = NA)

psa_output <- run_psa(psa_samp = my_psa_params,
                      params_basecase = l_params_basecase,
                      FUN = calculate_ce_out,
                      outcomes = c("Cost", "Effect", "NMB"),
                      strategies = c("No_Treatment", "Treatment"),
                      n_wtp = 150000,
                      progress = FALSE)
```

## Creating a Fully-functional PSA Object

`run_psa` will return a named list containing a `psa` object for each outcome specified in the `outcomes` argument. Each `psa` object in the list is compatible with `owsa()`, `twsa()`, and their associated downstream functions described in the `psa_analysis` vignette. However, most PSA analysis functions in `dampack` rely on the clear designation of both a cost and effectiveness outcome. To create a PSA object that is compatible with these functions related to cost-effectiveness you must input the results of `run_psa` into the `make_psa_obj` function in the following manner. `make_psa_obj()` requires data.frames for `cost`, `effect`, and `parameters`, and a character vector for `strategies`. The `data.frame`s containing each outcome in the list returned by `run_psa` are stored within `other_outcome`. In this example, the outcome associated with `effect` is named `"Effect"`, and so `psa_output$Effect$other_outcome` is supplied to the corresponding argument of `make_psa_obj`.

```{r}
cea_psa <- make_psa_obj(cost = psa_output$Cost$other_outcome, 
                        effect = psa_output$Effect$other_outcome, 
                        parameters = psa_output$Cost$parameters,
                        strategies = psa_output$Cost$strategies,
                        currency = "$")

```
